- â™‚  I'm Huan Nguyen (some of my clones: [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nguyenhuands99/), [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/nguyenhuands99) and also my open ports: [Gmail](mailto:nguyenhuands99@gmail.com), [Outlook](mailto:nguyenhuands99@outlook.com))

- ðŸŽ“ I'm an ~fresh graduate from University of Science - Vietnam~ ordinary developer who loves to try new ordinary things with software. 

- ðŸ–¥ I'm coding daily with ~Python on my Linux machine, which sometimes helps me shoot myself in the foot in a very efficient way. ðŸ¦¶ðŸ”«~ Typescript/C# in my at-work persona and code in whatever language I'm interested in my local machine.

- ðŸ§  I love building useful things with programming, acknowledging the art of software and data solutions, watching dataflows, finding insights through data, then iterate back and forth.
