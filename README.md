- 🎓 I'm a fresh graduate from University of Science - Vietnam. 

- 🖥 I'm coding daily with Python on my Linux machine, which sometimes helps me shoot myself in the foot in a very efficient way. 🔫🦶

- 🧠 I love building things with programming, seeing insights through data, then iterate back and forth.

- 🤷‍♂️ Internet is a scary thing then I must learn to understand it, so does AI/ML. 🤣
